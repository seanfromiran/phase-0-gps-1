###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I feel like I had a pretty solid understanding of git before the GPS session. 

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I now understand how merge conflicts can happen and how to prevent them from happening. Otherwise the session was actually more difficult and disorienting than working alone!

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked a lot of questions about which repository I should be in and whether to use the command line or GitHub due to being anxious and losing focus. 

###What still confuses you about git?
I am still confused about effectively merging repos. I was able to fetch the changes during Release 4, but the merge said the master branch was up to date. 

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was pretty difficult to stay focused while also having to communicate each step and make sure we were both on the same page. I was pretty anxious and temporarily forgot how to do some things that were previously obvious. It was awesome having someone to help when I was stuck and being able to help when the other person was confused, and the guide being there helped as well. When the guide left, we got a little lost on Release 4 and I wasn't able to merge the changes locally. Also, we didn't clarify what it meant to be a driver or navigator, and I was surprised at how difficult that made the workflow.
